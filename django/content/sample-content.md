### Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral

Situated just a stone’s throw away from the famed Colon Street, the Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral, or the Metropolitan Cathedral of St. Vitales, is a Roman Catholic Church which holds the ecclesiastical seat of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Cebu, considered by many to be the Fount of Christianity in the Far East.

The Second World War greatly damaged the cathedral, leaving mostly just the walls standing. the Church’s rich history is very much apparent from the its Spanish roots with Baroque-Rococo influences.

The brilliant interior design of the cathedral also serves as an incredible backdrop for wedding photos, making it highly desirable for weddings to be officiated in. Be sure to pay the Metropolitan Cathedral a visit; you might just witness a holy union!

### Cebu Taoist Temple

Open to believers and non-believers alike, the Cebu Taoist Temple sits 300 meters above sea level, towering over downtown Cebu. Accessible on foot through three separate, winding routes, this richly coloured temple is an absolute treat for the senses. Visitors will first be greeted by a small replica of the Great Wall of China located at the entrance of the temple. One can also find a chapel, library, and a wishing well amongst other things.

Visitors are also welcome to take part in a wish granting ritual, where visitors have to wash their hands before entering the chapel and tossing two blocks of wood onto the floor. Depending on how the blocks of woods land, the visitor could then have a chance to be granted a wish from the divine, or will have to make another visit to the temple for another chance for the wish to be granted.
